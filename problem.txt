##Rock, Paper, Scissors, Lizard, Spock

Tonight's homework is to create the Rock, Paper, Scissors, Lizard, Spock game in JavaScript/jQuery, where you play one-v-one against the computer.

The game is an expansion on the game Rock, Paper, Scissors. Each player picks a variable and reveals it at the same time. The winner is the one who defeats the others. In a tie, the process is repeated until a winner is found.
